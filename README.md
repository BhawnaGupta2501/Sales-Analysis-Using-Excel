Excited to share one of my projects in Excel: 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹.

In this project, I focused on cleaning and preprocessing data for creating an interactive and insightful dashboard for market and financial analysis.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀:
- Ensuring high-quality information for decision-making by cleaning the given products and sales data.
- Creating pivot tables and dashboards to provide comprehensive market and financial analysis from the analyzed data.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:
- 𝗣𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀: Analyzing sales data can reveal which menu items are top sellers, helping focus marketing efforts and menu improvements.
- 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀: Analyzing revenue streams can help identify opportunities for upselling, cross-selling, or introducing new products.
- 𝗣𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗛𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀: Identifying peak hours/days can help optimize staffing levels and product offerings during busy times.

This project demonstrates how to turn raw data into valuable information that guides strategic actions as well as improves decision making.

Happy Excelling!

Thank You!
